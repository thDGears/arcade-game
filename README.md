# Udacity Front End Track: Project 3 "Classic Arcade Game"

This is the third project of the **Udacity Front End Nanodegree Program**.

## Description

This is the classic arcade game, where the player needs to get to the water without been hit by the enemy.

### How to run

You can visit the live version directly: [Arcade Game](https://thdgears.github.io/arcade-game/) OR "clone/download" the source files to your computer, then open the "index.html" file in the browser.

### How to play

You have to pass through the enemy "bugs" in order to get to the water, each time you get there you'll score one point (shown at the top of the game).
If the enemy hit you, you'll be relocated to your initial position and you will lose all of your points.

Just use the **ARROW KEYS** on your keyboard to move the player.

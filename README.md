# Udacity Front End Track: Project 3 "Classic Arcade Game"

This is the third project of the **Udacity Front End Track**.

## Description

This is the classic arcade game "Froger game", where the player needs to get to the water without been detected by the enemy.

You have to pass through the enemy in order to get to the water, each time you get there you'll get one point.
If the enemy spotted you, you'll be relocated to your initial position and you will lose all of your points.

Just use the **ARROW KEYS** on your keyboard to move the player.

I'll be adding new features in the next update such; 
* Select player
* Timer
* Collect gems
* Increase the game difficulty each time the game won
* Adding "Music" ( sounds fun :D )
